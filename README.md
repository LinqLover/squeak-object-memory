# squeak-object-memory
Issues and assets related to the Squeak object memory.

The squeak-object-memory repository provides a GitHub location for issue tracking for the Squeak Smalltalk system (https://squeak.org/).

Most issues and development concerns are handled directly on the squeak-dev mailing list (http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/squeak-dev) with updates and contributions incorporated through our development process (https://squeak.org/development_process/).

Issues that may require longer term discussion or coordination may be tracked here in squeak-object-memory.

The term "object memory" is used here to reflect the entire Squeak system (consisting of an object memory image plus a virtual machine as its execution engine). Issues that are specific to the virtual machine may be separately tracked at https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm.
